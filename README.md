# Dimensionality Reduction Library
Python library for plu and play dimensionality reduction techniques.

The techniques that will be implemented are:
* t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE);
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA);
* Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP);
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
